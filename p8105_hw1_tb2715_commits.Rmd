#Setup
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)
```

#Problem 1

The chunk below creates a dataframe containing a sample of size 8 from a random normal distribution. Samples are classified as above or below 0 and the variable classification is explored between numeric and character variables.

```{r create dataframe}
eight_rand_df = tibble(
  norm_samp = rnorm(8),
  vec_logical = norm_samp > 0,
  vec_char = c("I", "enjoy", "yoga", "cookies", "nature", "dogs", "sunshine", "family"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("orange", "orange", "orange", "orange","blue", "blue", "blue", "magenta" )))

mean(pull(eight_rand_df, norm_samp))

mean(pull(eight_rand_df, vec_logical))

mean(pull(eight_rand_df, vec_char))

mean(pull(eight_rand_df, vec_factor))
```
